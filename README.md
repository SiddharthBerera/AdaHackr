"# AdaHackr" 
Project for the Adahackr blackrock hackathon.
The goal of this project was to make a web based, bitcoin paper trader. 
Users would then be able to paper trade on the platform and results would be published on a high scored page. 
This could then be used to verify the legitamcy of so called 'trading signal' providers, filtering out 'fake gurus' and other scammers.
